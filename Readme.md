# AudioBook: A tiny voice recorder app for personal use

> This is undoubedly the best full-stack assignment among all the others I have solved till date!

The assignment was to build a voice recorder app utilising Vue.js or any other preferred front-end framework and Node.js or Go as the back-end framework.

I used React.js under Next.js as the front-end framework. Additionally, I used [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for components and styling. For the back-end I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). Also there is a [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) implementation to stream the audio from the client to the server.

Although a minimal UI is asked for, mine is a bit aesthetically pleasing. I integrated [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) on the front-end to do so!
